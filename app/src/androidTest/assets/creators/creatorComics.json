In 1975, Jack “King” Kirby came back to Marvel and his iconic creation, Captain America, as writer, artist and editor. It was Kirby unleashed — and the results were groundbreaking. Kirby created an intricate storyline that built month after month toward America’s Bicentennial and CAPTAIN AMERICA #200! The “Madbomb” saga featured an aristocratic cabal seeking to wrest control of the country by possessing the American people’s minds and driving them to insane outbreaks of violence. It’s an Orwellian adventure done Kirby-style, and there’s nothing else like it!

In their latest, greatest Marvel Masterworks, the Fantastic Four confront one of their oldest enemies - the Skrulls!

The talents of Marv Wolfman, Keith Pollard and John Byrne - in his FF debut - keep the story feisty, the art spry and the adventure fantastic. How could it not be when the world-devourer Galactus enters the fray with a new herald? As if that weren't enough, the cosmic Sphinx, scheming Monocle, combustible Blastaar, formidable Frightful Four and diabolical Salem's Seven keep the scope epic, the stakes absolute, and you on the edge of your seat! And H.E.R.B.I.E.? He's just keeping it real.",
